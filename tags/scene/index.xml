      <description>Project overview   this project consists of evaluating the feasibility of an app that would return the nutriscore label from given features of a food product
  thus the project consists of a multi-label classification task with tabular data
  the overall performance of the trained estimator is positive and confirms the feasibility of such an app  Workflow summary   cleaned the product-related data from Open Food Facts database</description>

      <description>Project overview   This project is about building a classifier that predicts whether a borrower will default on his loan
  The underlying objective is to minimize as much as possible the risk to grant credit to a borrower that is likely to default
  Since the target is binary it consists of a supervised binary classification task   Workflow   aggregated the tables of the database</description>

      <description>Project overview   this project consists of estimating the model that would predict both CO2 emissions and the energy consumption of non-residential buildings in the city of Seattle
  thus the project addresses regression problems with tabular data
  the overall performance of the fitted model is robust and the few features it needs as input allow a clear interpretation of the defined model   Workflow   cleaned the data</description>

      <description>Project overview   The goal of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of an automatic classification that would predict product categories upon images and/or text
  We will therefore implement Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques
  Since the data is labeled we will consider it a supervised multi-label classification task
  the overall performance of the fitted model is strong and thus confirms the feasibility of the automatic classification   Workflow summary   explored the target variables</description>

      <description>Project overview   this project consists of estimating a segmentation model that would separate the e-consumers of a platform into coherent and business-wise interpretable groups
  thus the project consists of a clustering task with tabular data
  the defined clusters are quite robust, well balanced and meaningful in a business-sense   Workflow   aggregated the tables of the database
  cleaned the data</description>

      <description>Project overview   This project compares countries performance accross several educational-related indicators and produces a ranking with a scoring tool
  It may be useful for the method it deploys and to understand how data visualization may be helpful for any BI project   Workflow   explored educational-related data from World Bank database
  identified key indicators
  cleaned the data
  produced visualizations to compare regions/countries accross chosen indicators over time</description>
