      <description>Project overview   This project consists of evaluating the feasibility of an app that would return the nutriscore label from given features of a food product
  The overall performance of the trained estimators is significantly positive and confirms the feasibility of such an app  Workflow   cleaned the product-related data from Open Food Facts database
  selected relevant features
  imputed missing values of relevant features with models</description>

      <description>Project overview   this project consists of estimating the model that would predict both CO2 emissions and the energy consumption of non-residential buildings in the city of Seattle
  thus the project addresses regression problems with tabular data
  the overall performance of the fitted model is robust and the few features it needs as input allow a clear interpretation of the defined model   Workflow   cleaned the data</description>

      <description>Project overview   this project consists of estimating a segmentation model that would separate the e-consumers of a platform into coherent and business-wise interpretable groups
  thus the project consists of a clustering task with tabular data
  the defined clusters are quite robust, well balanced and meaningful in a business-sense   Workflow   aggregated the tables of the database
  cleaned the data</description>

      <description>Project overview This project compares countries performance accross several educational-related indicators and produces a ranking with a scoring tool. It may be useful for the method it deploys and to understand how data visualization may be helpful for any BI project.Workflow   worked with educational-related data from EdStats World Bank database
  identified key indicators
  cleaned the data
  produced visualizations to compare regions/countries accross chosen indicators over time</description>
